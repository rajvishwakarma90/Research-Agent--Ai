# Research-Agent--Ai
project pn research agent ai using ibm cloud (watsonsx.ai granite model) and RAG.


 Research Agent AI
An AI-powered research assistant built using IBM Granite Foundation Model and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on IBM Cloud Lite (Watsonx.ai). This agent automates literature review, citation analysis, and research summarization to support academic and industrial researchers.

🧠 Features
📚 Semantic Search: Search across research papers, datasets, and journals using natural language.

📝 Auto-Summarization: Quickly summarize key insights from research documents.

🔗 Citation Analysis: Understand paper influence and citation patterns.

💡 Hypothesis Generation: Identify gaps in research and suggest possible new directions.

🤝 Collaboration Mapping: Discover potential collaborators and co-authorships.

🛠️ Technologies Used
✅ IBM Cloud Lite Services

🧠 IBM Granite Foundation Model

📦 IBM Watsonx.ai Studio & Runtime

🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

🧮 Vector Indexing for fast document retrieval

☁️ IBM Cloud Object Storage

🚀 How It Works
User enters a research-related question.

The system performs semantic search over indexed literature using vector similarity.

IBM Granite generates a response based on the retrieved context (RAG approach).

Response is returned via a simple Flask-based API.


📌 Notes
This model is deployed and runs on IBM Cloud Watsonx.ai, using IBM’s Granite LLM with a serverless RAG-based architecture.
It is optimized for researchers and students to save time, enhance quality, and support interdisciplinary innovation.
